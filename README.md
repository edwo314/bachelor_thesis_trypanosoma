# Bachelor Thesis: Trypanosoma Code Repository

This repository contains the code used for generating plots and statistics in my Bachelor's thesis related to *Trypanosoma*. The code is provided "AS IS", without warranty of completeness or functionality, as it was created for specific, non-general purposes.

## Disclaimer
- The code may not be user-friendly, and it was not intended for use by the general public.
- Users should be cautious and aware that some files need to be run in a specific order due to dependencies on the output of other files.

## Usage

### Initial Setup
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` using a virtual environment (recommended). Additional installation instructions for `tryptag`, `umap`, and `intel` extension for `scikit-learn` are included within `requirements.txt`.

### Dataset Preparation
1. Run `get_flagella_dataset.py` to download the necessary dataset.
2. Execute `compute_segmentation_masks_and_dataset.py` to create k-means models for segmentation and generate segmentation masks for the entire dataset.

### Important Files to Run in Order
- `resize_images.py`
- `resnet_image_preprocessing.py`
- `resnet_plot.py`

## File Descriptions

- `clustering_metrics.py`: Generates plots for the Elbow Method and Silhouette Scores for a given input image.
- `compute_segmentation_masks_and_dataset.py`: Creates segmentation masks for the whole dataset and saves them to `dataset/raw`. Additionally, it generates and saves all models used for segmentation under `kmeans_models`.
- `constants.py`: Contains a dictionary with all genes used to identify the flagella.
- `gene_selection.py`: Locates genes that localize the paraflagellar rod and ranks them based on percentile scores available on a specified website.
- `get_flagella_dataset.py`: Downloads the dataset using a dictionary of genes.
- `kinetoplast_nuclei_properties_all_configurations.py` and `kinetoplast_nuclei_properties_individual_configurations.py`: These files generate plots showcasing various kinetoplast and nuclei properties such as minor axis length, major axis length, orientation, mean and max DNA intensity, and area.
- `length_histograms.py`: Generates histograms representing the length of the flagella and cells, including corrected measurements.
- `mask_generation.py`: This script was used for data exploration purposes.
- `multivariate_analysis.py`: Creates plots for multivariate analysis.
- `resize_images.py` and `resnet_image_preprocessing.py`: These files resize and preprocess images for the ResNet model and prepare them for display in interactive Plotly charts.
- `resnet_plot.py`: Generates an interactive plot showcasing the principal components of the feature vector of the ResNet50 model.
- `tryptag_copy.py`: A potentially modified copy of `tryptag.py` from the TrypTag GitHub repository.
- `tryptools_copy.py`: A potentially modified copy of `tryptools.py` from the TrypTag GitHub repository.


### Modified Files from TrypTag Repository
This repository includes modified copies of files originally from the [TrypTag GitHub repository](https://github.com/zephyris/tryptag/tree/main).
- `tryptag_copy.py` and `tryptools_copy.py` are altered to support the `kinetoplast_nuclei_properties_all_configurations.py` and `kinetoplast_nuclei_properties_individual_configurations.py` files by adding necessary information for ellipse reconstruction from DNA masks. Replace the original `tryptag.py` and `tryptools.py` in your virtual environment with these copies and then rename them.

## Contribution & Support
Since this code was used specifically for my Bachelorâ€™s thesis, it is not designed for general use or ongoing support. For reference and replication purposes in academic work, you're welcome to use and modify the code while citing appropriate sources.
